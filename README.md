## Description

The Proxy Formatter is a Python script designed to test and validate the functionality of HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies. It reads a list of proxies from a file, tests each one for connectivity, and saves the working proxies to a separate file. The script utilizes the `requests` library for HTTP/HTTPS requests and `socks` for SOCKS proxy connections.

### Features
- Supports testing for HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies.
- Automatically disables SSL certificate warnings for HTTPS requests.
- Outputs the list of functional proxies to a file.
- Easy-to-configure input and output file paths.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x** is required.
- Required libraries: `requests`, `pysocks`, `urllib3`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install requests pysocks urllib3
```

## Usage

1. **Input File**:
   - Ensure that the `proxy.txt` file is located in the same directory as the script.
   - Add the list of proxies in the following format:
     ```plaintext
     proxy_host:proxy_port:username:password
     ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script and run:
     ```bash
     python proxy.py
     ```

3. **View the Results**:
   - The script will test each proxy in the list and save the working proxies to a file named `working_proxies.txt` in the same directory.

## File Paths
- **Input file:** `proxy.txt` — Contains the list of proxies to be tested.
- **Output file:** `working_proxies.txt` — Contains the list of validated and working proxies.

## Notes
- The script uses a test URL (`http://example.com`) to check the validity of each proxy.
- Proxies that fail the connection test or timeout will not be included in the output file.
